# SDLAsteroids
An Asteroids clone made in C++ with SDL2 as my submission for my Object Oriented Games Programming module during my first year at university.

 
The visual and audio assets were gathered from various sources, namely the [Background](https://deep-fold.itch.io/space-background-generator) from itch.io and the music from the artist [Context Sensitive](https://www.youtube.com/ContextSensitive)
